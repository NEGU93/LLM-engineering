# 🚀 NEGU93 – AI & LLM Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI & Machine Learning portfolio showcase**.  
This repository aggregates my key projects as **Git submodules**, making it easy to explore my work in one place.

Each project demonstrates different skills — from fine-tuning LLMs, to building conversational AI interfaces, to deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
